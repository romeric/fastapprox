# fastapprox
Approximate and vectorized versions of common mathematical functions

The easiest way to include this in your projects is via the one big standalone header file which works with both C and C++.

### Current functions:

 - exponential, logarithm, and power
 - lgamma and digamma
 - cosh, sinh, tanh
 - cos, sin, tan
 - sigmoid and erf
 - Lambert W

There's a Mathematica notebook which helps explain the techniques.
